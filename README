This directory contains calc++, a simple Bison grammar file in C++.

Please, read the corresponding chapter in the documentation: "A Complete C++
Example".  It is also available on line (maybe with a different version of
Bison):

LINUX

run flex:
flex -o scanner.cc scanner.ll

run bison:
bison -o parser.cc parser.yy

build executable:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../

>42

---------------------------------------------

WINDOWS

run flex:
win_flex --wincompat -o scanner.cc scanner.ll

run bison:
win_bison -o parser.cc parser.yy

build executable:
md build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ../
nmake install

run the binary:
cd bin
calc.exe input.txt
>42

---------------------------------------------

It is a simple calculator which accepts
several variable definitions, one per line, and then a single expression to
evaluate.

The program calc++ expects the file to parse as argument; pass `-` to read
the standard input (and then hit <Ctrl-d>, control-d, to end your input).

$ ./calc++ -
one := 1
two := 2
three := 3
(one + two * three) * two * three
<Ctrl-d>
42

You may pass `-p` to activate the parser debug traces, and `-s` to activate
the scanner's.
